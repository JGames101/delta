<h2>2.0b</h2><br>
<h3>Overview</h3><br>
v2.0 is a massive redesign to the site. There are huge internal and external changes to the site, ranging from the design, the menu, the offline behaviour, and much, much more.<br>
<ul>

	<li>Menu Changes
	<li>Videos Page
	<li>Offline Behaviour
	<li>Internal Changes
</ul>
<br>
<h3>New Design</h3><br>
The default design has changed from...<br>
<img src="/setup/screenshots/old/photo.png" width="100%">
To...<br>
<img src="/setup/screenshots/colourful.png" width="100%">
The default 8 themes have been replaced with Colourful, Light, Dark, Simple, Simple Light, and Simple Dark.<br>
The new flat design replaces the card design. On light and colourful themes, the background is white with 10% transparency, and on dark themes, the background is dark with 10% transparency.<br>
Everything has been restyled, but all the cards are in the exact same place.<br>
<br>
<h3>New Menu</h3><br>
The old, side menu has been replaced with the new modular menu system.<br>
By default, there are two menu styles: Expanding, which mimicks the old menu, but from the top, and Simple, which is based off of material guidelines to give a great user experience.<br>
The new modular menu system puts the css for a menu in its own files, meaning that the menu designs have much more freedom to easily change the design of the page completely.<br>
<br>
<h3>Videos Page</h3><br>
The new videos page has a list of all the videos on the site (and, in future releases, photos too).<br>
When selected, the video will play in a custom youtube player. This player loads in the video, as well as the title, creator, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and description.<br>
It will play any video on youtube if you enter the ID in the address bar.<br>
This page builds upon what I learned making the TXT viewer. The Video player finds the ID from the URL, and uses the YouTube API to request the information on that video. It then returns JSON with the title, creator, description, and a lot more. It then loads it in to the player, and plays the video.<br>
<br>
<h3>Offline behaviour</h3><br>
The new modular page design (see below) means that now, the offline functionality has been masively changed. The service worker saves the menu, css, and javascript, and, when online, loads the page. But if the user is offline, it will load in the menu, as normal, as well as the new "Offline" page.<br>
That means that the site container is saved offline, but the content is replaced by an offline message, to give a more consistent offline experience. This will be further updated in the future, to give more things to do offline.<br>
This feature is still in progress, and will be updated with more things to do in the future.<br>
<br>
<h3>Internal Changes</h3><br>
As mentioned above, huge elements of the site have been changed. The content of the page, and the menu, are modularized, giving so much more speed and simpleness to the site.<br>
The mobile site has also been improved massively speed-wise: the background image no longer exsists on mobile, so that less data is required to load the page. The new modular design means that elements such as the menu can be loaded in before the content, much like Twitter Light, again allowing for a much faster experience.<br>
The modular menu means that it is much easier to have custom menus, or update the menu with a new page.<br>
