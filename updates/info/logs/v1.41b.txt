<h3>Tablet Mode Changes</h3><br>
While the mobile page has updated from just a single-collumed version of the site to its own design, tablet mode has remained almost idential to the desktop version.<br>
This is about to change in future updates. Major changes to Tablet Mode will be coming in the future, but this version has 2 relatively minor changes:<br>
<h4>Wide Cards</h4><br>
Certain content, such as Berlin VR, certain updates, or JQuery experiments have been set to be double width on tablet mode.<br>That means that instead of having 2 cards in a row, there is only one.<br>
not all cards will get this, only certain ones.<br>
<h4>Correct Devices</h4><br>
Changes have been made to the selection for the CSS, so that only tablets get tablet mode, instead of some laptops, and some small tablets getting the Phone UI.<br>
If everything went right, this shouldn't be noticable, but you may notice a new collum of tiles on your laptop.<br>
