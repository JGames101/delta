<h2>1.22b</h2><br>
<h3>Overview</h3><br>
1.22b is a bugfix and small feature update. There are very few new features, but 1.22b does contain a few important features.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Fixes for expand menu button on mobile.
	<li>File Information on JavaScript page.
	<li>New updates notification system.
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Expand Button Bugfixes</h3><br>
On Phones, the expand button now points vertically, rather than horizontally.<br>
This is because on Phones, the navigation bar is placed at the top, rather than the left.<br>
The expand button has been given overflow: none, so that the scrollbar doesn't appear.<br>
<br>
<h3>JavaScript File Information</h3><br>
There is a new file Information card on the JavaScript page.<br>
When you select a file, it will show the name, size, and type.<br>
This feature is in Alpha, because in the future it will have the ability to read TXT files in the future, as well as read JSON, and much more.<br>
<br>
<h3>New Update Notification System</h3><br>
Much like YouTube or Google Drive, there is now always active notifications that will notify you whenever an update is available. This also applies to mobile.<br>
This works by using the Service Worker. When latest.json is updated, the service worker will see that, and deliver a notification.<br>
This feature is also in Beta. It will be further updated and improved as time goes on.<br>
