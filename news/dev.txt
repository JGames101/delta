<h2>Developping The Newsfeeds on the Homescreen</h2><br>
As of Version 2.2y, there are now 3 newsfeeds on the homescreen: News, Code, and Media. They may not seem like much, but they are a huge deal, because they update independantly from the homescreen's code.<br>
Usually, to implement something on the page, you would just put the code where on that page you want it. But with this feature, the idea is that the newsfeeds can be updated independantly from the homescreen. This was achieved using JSON.<br>
Inside the code of the homescreen, there are 9 empty cards for the newsfeed. They are only there to make it easier, but this could work without them as well, by generating the code completely.<br>
To get the contents of the cards, the <a href="/news/homescreen.js">homescreen.js</a> file looks at the JSON for the 3 most recent news bits. Here's what a newsbit looks like:<br>
<code>
"n4": {
    "title":"4 NEW IMAGES",
    "body":"Update 2.2y has Added 4 new Images, including Crayons, Wildflowers, and Québec City.",
    "image":"/photos/11-240.jpg",
    "page":"/videos",
    "context":"image",
    "timestamp":"171104.0557"
},
</code>
What does it mean?<br>
n4 means that this is the fourth newsbit from that feed (in this case news). That is used to get the latest newsbits.<br>
Inside of n4, there are different parts of the newsbit, which are used to render the newsbit.<br>
Title is pretty obvious: It's the title of the newsbit.<br>
Body is the text content of the newsbit.<br>
Image is the image displayed alongside the newsbit (some don't have images, so their image value is set to none).<br>
Page is the link that the button at the bottom should take the user to (again, not all newsbits have pages, so some have a value of none, which makes no button appear).<br>
Context in an upoming feature that will select the context menu that will appear, when custom context menus are implemented. That will control what options appear.<br>
Timestamp is when the newsbit was created, for ordering purposes.<br>
<br>
This results in something that looks like this:<br>
<div class="mdc-card demo-card" id="newsCard1">
<div class="mdc-card__horizontal-block">
    <section class="mdc-card__primary">
    <h1 class="mdc-card__title mdc-card__title--large" id="newsTitle1" style="text-align:left">4 NEW IMAGES</h1>
    <h2 class="mdc-card__subtitle" id="newsBody1">Update 2.2y has Added 4 new Images, including Crayons, Wildflowers, and Québec City.</h2>
    </section>
    <img class="mdc-card__media-item" id="newsImage1" src="/photos/11-240.jpg">
</div>
<section class="mdc-card__actions">
    <a id="newsButton1" href="/videos" style="display: block;"><button class="mdc-button mdc-button--compact mdc-card__action">View</button></a>
</section>
</div>
You may be wondering, hang on, ordering purposes? Isn't that what the number is for?<br>
And you're right. But the timestamp is different, because it's designed to be used when multiple newsfeeds are being rendered together, which will hopefully be coming in an upcoming release.<br>
So that's how this feature was made. It's pretty significant, because it leads the way for more content that doesn't need to be hardcoded into the HTML. There are so many benefits to this, like how the JSON could be called on for the content of a page, rather than reloading the whole page. It's pretty powerful.<br>
Regardless, this is just the start of the newsfeed. The lightning fast nature of these files could lead to more advanced uses in the future.<br>
