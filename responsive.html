		<h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
		<p>Currently, every page on my site is responsive (go ahead, try it!) thanks to the card layout. As such, building responsive sites is currently not a focus for me. What I'm mostly focusing on right now is learning AngularJS and building Offline Web Apps. Don't worry, this page will be eventually updated with Responsive Web Experiments, but for now, this is all you get.</p>
