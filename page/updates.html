		<h2>v3.0δ</h2>
		<p>This version builds upon the fact that page content is loaded in seperately from the page in v2.0. At the time, this feature was added for speed reasons.<br>
		But in this version, there is no longer an index.html file for every page. Instead, there is only the root index.html file. The htaccess no longer redirects to the 404 page. Instead, it redirects to index.html.<br>
		global.js now loads in HTML content not based on page title, but based on page URL.<br>
		When clicking a link, the page is no longer reloaded. Instead, it uses the History API to change the URL and replaces the content of the page.<br>
		When watching a video through the video viewer, If you click a button to leave the HTML page, it plays in a PiP mode.<br>
		2 new photos have been added.<br>
		The Setup page no longer looks completely seperate to the site. Instead, it looks just like any other page, with the menu at the top.<br>
		Every page still has its own URL, so it behaves as excepted when sharing.<br>
		The code page has finally been implemented, with links to all the code pages.</p>

		<h2>v2.31γ</h2>
		<p>The News Article Page has been Redesigned. It is now a fixed size, and the content scrolls, rather than the whole site. The actions are also now along the top.<br>
		News stories can now be loaded from the Updates Page, so that the site doesn't have to load the news page to open an article. The goal is for this to be the behavior for all media to improve the speed of the site.<br>
		On supported versions, the more info button now opens the news viewer rather than the old TXT viewer.<br>
		More changes will be coming in future updates, such as overlays for new users, notifications, no javascript, as well as media.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card card2">
		<h2>v2.3γ</h2>
		<p>This Update adds a new page: News.<br>
		News has updates and developer logs about the site.<br>
		It loads articles with JSON to be extremely quick.<br>
		It is also the first page on the site with true offline support, meaning that it works when offline. However, to be able to read an article offline, you need to first choose to save the article offline when you are online. This will be coming to all future features on the site for better offline support.<br>
		The service worker has finally been fixed to not cache all loaded files, so Offline support works as intended once again.</p>

	<div class="card card2">
		<h2>v2.2γ</h2>
		<p>The Homescreen has been completely redesigned to emphasize content, as well as featuring the new news page.<br>
		The news page has multiple feeds, including Updates, and a lot more.<br>
		The newsfeed API allows different feeds, such as Updates, Media, Code, and more to work. It works with JSON, so it's easy to add update independantly from the homepage.<br>
		There are three feeds on the homepage: News, which shows announcements and updates, code, which emphasizes the code behind features, and media, which puts a spotlight on the different media on the site.<br>
		This update also redesigns major parts of the site with more Material Components, such as Material Buttons and Cards.<br>
		Secondary colour is now selectable in setup and options, and applies to buttons and certain other UI elements.<br>
		As mentioned in the newsfeed, there are now four new images: Wildflowers, Kelowna, Québec City, and Crayons.<br>
		<b style="color:red">WARNING:</b> Themes are currently broken. They will be fixed in a future version of the site with an improved Theme API 2.0.</p>

		<h2>v2.1γ</h2>
		<p>Material Design Components have been fully implemented into the site. You can see this most notably on the JavaScript page, but it also slightly changes the header, and some other things as well.<br>
		There is a new menu design, to emphasize the three things that the site focuses on: Code, Media, and Options. Code will, in a future release, take you to a new page.<br>
		From tests with the new Web Share API, there is now a share button on videos, photos, and some code games. On browsers that support Web Share API, that will appear. On other browsers, it will open a new email with the link.<br>
		Photos page has been completely redesigned to be more like a photos viewer, and loads image from URL.<br>
		There is now and expand/contract button beside headers for categories of cards, much like the advanced section in option.<br>
		The Updates page has been seperated into three sections: Gamma, Beta, and Alpha.<br>
		The Versions previously known as Beta 2 is now known as the Gamma release.<br>
		Version 2.2γ will be coming soon with more improvements.</p>

		<h2>v2.01γ</h2>
		<p>As v2.0b fixed the offline functionality, the only missing requirement for PWA was speed on 3G networks. This version has a lot of small changes that make access on 3G networks working well.<br>
		This includes delaying the loading of JQuery and Modernizr until the initial page has been loaded in, and then delaying loading the content of the page until everything is loaded.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card card2">
		<h2>v2.0γ</h2>
